Project Summary: Utilising React's component-based architecture and efficient rendering, this project illustrates CRUD functionality from a front-end perspective.

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion web app using the below API. Articles are divided into topics and each article has user-curated ratings and comments. Planned with wireframes and component tree diagrams and built with React and Axios, this front-end project incorporates the handling of state, routing and error handling.
